        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <h2>Giving you back your data!</h2>
        <p>
            You have seen it time and time again:<br/>
            Cloud this.<br>
            It is fun to share.<br>
            Store your stuff here.<br>
            Have no fear!<br>
            We promise no data breaches this year!!!<br><br>
            If you are sick and tired of the same old corporate promises like us, well then you have come to the right place. Here at Stilt Fox&trade; we cannot lose your data because we do not collect it.
            We believe in giving you control of your life again. This means storing files on your local machines, offering conveniences only previously seen online, and revitalizing the 
            boxed software market. We believe that when you buy a license you have the right to use that software, period. No more leasing, no more borrowing, no more paying rent, this software is yours to use as you see fit.

        <h1>About Stilt Fox&trade;</h1>
        <p>
            Stilt Fox&trade; is focused on creating software products that give users control over their digital life. We believe that as big tech draws farther and farther away from public interest that
            software alternatives need to be offered, both paid and non-paid. We feel that customers and products should be the focus, not data collection and advertisement. We are here to cut the fancy
            sales pitches and jargon to offer focused and concise technical experiences. It is time to take a deep breath and come down from the cloud.<br><br>
            <h2>What we mean by customer focused</h2>
            <p>
                To us, customer focus means that we should not engage in predatory anti-consumer sales tactics. some examples include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Data collection of any type</li>
                    <li>Micro-transaction laden phone applications</li>
                    <li>Use of FOMO (the fear of missing out)</li>
                    <li>Subscriptions for EVERYTHING</li>
                    <li>Excessive use of Corporate lingo to confuse customers</li>
                    <li>Using cloud to enforce lack of ownership of purchased goods</li>
                </ul>
                If, like us, you are sick of this kind of nonsense then we hope our products will offer you a breath of fresh air.
            </p>

        <h1>Supporting the Cause</h1>
        <p>
            Stilt Fox&trade; aims to provide quality privacy focused software, but to do that we unfortunately require funds. To achieve this we will be opening a patreon account where you can help
            fund our efforts if you want to. We will use these funds to create new software products, maintain existing ones, and talk about alternatives to big tech. As a cool little bonus
            we will also talk about how to start your own project and teach some coding skills so you can join us in creating software for the people.
