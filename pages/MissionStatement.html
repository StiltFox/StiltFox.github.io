        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <h2>Giving you back your data!</h2>
        <p>
            You've seen it time and time again:<br/><br/>
            Cloud this,<br/>
            It's fun to share,<br/>

            If your sick and tired of the same old corporate promices like me, well then you've come to the right place. Here at Stilt Fox™ we cant lose your data because we dont collect it.
            we believe in giving you control of your life again. This means storing files on your local machienes. Offering conveiniences only previously seen online, and revitializing the 
            boxed software market. We believe that when you buy a product you own that copy. No more leasing, no more borrowing, no more paying rent, this software is yours to use as you see fit.

        <h1>About Stilt Fox™</h1>
        <p>
            Stilt Fox™ is a company that creates desktop solutions for modern problems. Here at Stilt Fox™ we believe that not everything belongs in the cloud. It's so easy to get drawn in 
            by pretty buzz words, fancy sales pitches, ect..., but we want to put technology back into your hands. We're here to cut the corporate jargen and provide tech in a non-confusing,
            customer focused way.<br/><br/>
            <h2>What do we mean by customer focused?</h2>
            <p>
                To us, customer focus means that we should not engage in preditory anti-consumer sales tactics. some examples include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Data collection of any type</li>
                    <li>Microtransaction laden phone applications</li>
                    <li>Use of FOMO (the fear of missing out)</li>
                    <li>Subscriptions for EVERYTHING!!!!!!!</li>
                    <li>Excessive use of Corporate lingo to confuse customers</li>
                    <li>Using cloud to enforce lack of ownership of purchaced goods</li>
                </ul>
                If you like us are sick of this kind of nonsense, we hope our products will offer you a breath of fresh air.
            </p>

        <h1>Supporting the Cause</h1>
        <p>
            Stilt Fox™ aims to provide quality privacy focused software, but to do that we unfortunatly require funds. To achieve this we will be opening a patreon account where you can help
            fund our efforts if you want to. We will use these funds to create new software products, maintain existing ones, and talk about alturnitives to big tech. As a cool little bonus
            we'll also talk about how to start your own project and teach some coding skills so you can join us in creating software for the people.
