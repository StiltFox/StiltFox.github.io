        <product-item data-name="This Website!!!!" data-version="N/A" data-link="https://github.com/StiltFox/StiltFox.github.io">
            That's right, even this website itself is open source! Go ahead and take a peak at what's going on behind the scenes. There are no helpful comments or anything, after all we want to run our website 
            lean, however it's a fun look at what it takes to make a simple website and host it on github.<br><br>
            Here at Stilt Fox&trade; we value simplicity over fancy frameworks.
